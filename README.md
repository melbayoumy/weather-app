# Weather App

This project is a weather app which consumes [openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/) api

## Tech

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Demo

[https://website-app.onrender.com/](https://website-app.onrender.com/)

## Get it working

You need to set the `env` variable `REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY`. It should have the value of your `openweathermap api key`. You can get one from [here](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys)

__Hint__: you can create a `.env` file in the project's root dir and define the variable in it

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
